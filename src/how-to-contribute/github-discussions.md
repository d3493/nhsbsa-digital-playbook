## Github Discussions

We use [Github discussions](https://github.com/nhsbsa/nhsbsa-digital-playbook/discussions) to suggest changes or improvements to the playbook.

Discussions are an open forum which allows you to collaborate with others to suggest changes or improvements.

Each discussion category is broken down by specific area of discipline e.g. UCD, Development, Product Ownership etc..., as well as general ideas.

### How do I suggest a change or improvement?

1. Create or login to your [Github account](https://github.com/join?source=login).
2. Go to the DDaT Playbook [github discussions](https://github.com/nhsbsa/nhsbsa-digital-playbook/discussions) page.
3. Select the area that the change or improvement refers to e.g. UCD, Development, Product Ownership, General Playbook Ideas etc...
4. Select 'New discussion'.
5. Collaborate and flesh out your idea with your community.

### What should a discussion include?

When suggesting an improvement, consider:

##### 1. What

Give a brief description of the proposal.

##### 2. Why

Explain why you think this should be added to the Playbook:
  
  - What evidence do you have that it's needed?
  - What evidence do you have that it meets the needs of our people and the services they build?
  - Have you checked that it doesn't already exist in the Playbook?

##### 3. Anything else

Include links to any examples, research or code to support your proposal, if available.

### How will discussions be priorised and actioned?

Each individual discussion allows people to mark what is most helpful:

The discussions with the most votes will be discussed every 2 weeks by the DDaT Playbook working group and, depending on how complete the request is, will be prioritised and actioned by the group.
