Emily Webber, the former Head of Agile Delivery for the Government Digital Service (GDS), offered a valuable starting point in defining the Delivery Manager role. She defined the role as:

> The servant leader, who keeps pace with the introduction of relevant agile and lean tools and techniques and removes obstacles and blockers that might get in the way of delivery
> 
> _Emily Webber_

The definition breaks down the role into three distinct areas and establishes what the role is accountable for:

### Agile and Lean Practices
