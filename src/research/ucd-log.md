The following should be used as guidance in writing a user research entry as part of a team’s user centred design log. The below should be included as a minimum within an entry, though there is flexibility to include other elements if relevant. 

Each entry should be structured around a particular block of research. This will be different depending on what your project is working on, and the phase it is in. For example, the entry may be written about a 6–8-week block of research about a new functionality for your service. Alternatively, it may be written about a 2–3-week block of research focused on the current experiences of contact centre agents on a given workstream. You may wish to take notes as you go or wait til the research has concluded and review your insight reports to condense and write up the information here. If you return to the same topic of research a few months later, create a new entry.  

Date the entry so that it is clear how long it was worked upon. If you come back to researching the same thing again in the future, create a new entry that is clearly dated and explains why further research is being conducted.  

These entries are useful in providing an accurate and up to date account of research that has taken place within a team. This will be beneficial when there are changeovers within the team, when forward planning, and for service assessments.

Each entry should take around 20-40 minutes to write and should not be longer than two pages. This is because the purpose of this log is to provide a condensed and quick-to-read overview of research that has taken place, with additional depth of detail being found within your insight reports. If you are regularly exceeding this time frame and length, feed this back to a senior user researcher.

## Sample file structure

A standard file structure will help us ensure that logs from different services remain consistent, making it easier for people to find the logs if they switch projects.

The agreed structure is:
`Service > Phase > Functionality/block of research > Date entry covers > UR/design entry`

So that becomes, for example:
`NHS Jobs > Public beta > Search function > June – August 2021 > User research`

## Suggested subheadings

### Who worked on the research

Detail the names and email addresses pof who worked on the piece of work you are writing about. This includes members of the ReOps and design team. This is to ensure that there is an accurate audit trail of who worked on what research and when, so that there is someone to contact if any questions arise.

### Brief background and purpose of the research

This is where you describe the context you’re working in and leading to the block of research. For example:
- Highlighting where this research sits as part of a development roadmap 
- Restrictions of scope imposed by external or internal requirements 
- Testing a new set of assumptions based on business decisions 
- Looking to explain anomalies in site analytics or user feedback 
- Building upon a longer-term exploration of the user journey to understand the experience and needs of people with specific circumstances not captured in regular recruitment. 

### Methodology

Selecting which research method(s), you use and developing any resources to support is an integral part of research design. Record which research method(s) were applied to each sprint and what analysis methods were used: for example, semi-structured interviews and thematic analysis. If you used a scenario as part of testing, specify what it was. If you are tracking metrics, ensure that these are also included & the source.

### Participants involved

A brief description of the user groups, personas, or other selection criteria, involved in this block of research.

### Summary of insights

Review your research findings and articulate these as insights. This section should be used to highlight key things that you have learned through your research, that you will then use to produce recommendations and structure your outcomes and next steps. You may find producing a list of bullet points helps to retain your focus on keeping these condensed and focused, particularly if you are writing this entry from research that has taken place across a number of sprints.

### Outcomes and next steps

Based on your insights, address what the outcomes from this piece of work are. This could be:

- Changes to the design (link to the relevant design log here – you do not need to write these up yourself) 
- Workshops within the team  
- What has come out of the research you need to explore next 
- How this research has shifted/confirmed priorities

### Loose ends for future work

Due to timescales and changes in priorities we may not always have the chance to do everything we had initially set out to do. If applicable, you can suggest here any elements that you did not get a chance to work on that you would want to do in the future. 

### Relevant links

Include links that are of relevance to this piece of research. This includes but is not limited to: insight reports, Miro boards, Teams folders and Confluence spaces. You do not need to provide links to prototypes or GitHub repositories, as the designer on your project will be collating this information in a separate entry.
