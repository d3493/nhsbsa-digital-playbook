## Security

* [UK Government Cyber Security Strategy: 2022 to 2030](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-cyber-security-strategy-2022-to-2030)

  All suppliers must align to the HMG cyber security strategy and must evidence how this requirement is achieved.

* [NCSC guidance on offline backups](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/blog-post/offline-backups-in-an-online-world)

  Solutions, services, and systems must have the ability to recovery from a catastrophic event such as a ransomware attack.  To ensure this is achievable offline backups must be in place and must align to the NCSC guidance on offline backups.  This must be evidenced and must be tested on a regular basis.

* [NCSC cloud security principles](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/cloud/the-cloud-security-principles)

  The cloud security principles - NCSC.GOV.UK

  Solutions, services, and systems hosted in the cloud (public cloud or SaaS) must follow the security principles set out by the NCSC and must be evidenced.

* [NCSC secure design principles](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/cyber-security-design-principles)

  Solutions, services, and systems need to be designed and constructed in a safe and secure manor.  To achieve this the secure design principles from NCSC must be followed to ensure that the networks and technologies which underpin modern life are designed and built securely.  Evidence of how the principles are met is required.

* [NCSC secure system administration](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/secure-system-administration)

  Solutions, services, and systems that that require access from a third party need to ensure the NCSC guidance on secure system administration is followed and the third party must evidence the compliance with the principles.  This requirement includes migration of systems as well as ongoing access as part of any support and maintenance arrangements.

* [NCSC secure development principles](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/developers-collection/principles)

  Secure development principles for any solutions, services, or systems used by the NHS Business Services Authority are essential to good cyber hygiene.  Understanding how third parties and suppliers embrace these principles is key to risk management and reduction.  Evidence will be required from third parties and suppliers on how the NCSC secure development practises are adopted across the solutions, services, and systems they provide.

* [NCSC cyber assessment framework (CAF)](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/caf)  // critical national infrastructure

  Solutions, services, and systems that are classified as critical national infrastructure (CNI) must complete a CAF with evidence provided of the current maturity assessment for each section.

* [NCSC Machine Learning Principles](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/machine-learning-principles)
