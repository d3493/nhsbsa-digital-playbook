## Introduction

This guidance helps content designers complete their service team’s User Centred Design (UCD) log. It is a general guide to best practice. You should raise any specific service questions with the service team.

The UCD log is used to inform the reader about the content design undertaken and the outcomes of that work. As a designer, it’s important that you make sure there are no knowledge gaps in your log. This can then support any new team member joining the service, particularly those joining the UCD team. It also provides valuable information to support a project service assessment.

This guidance outlines the steps you should take to create your UCD design log entry.

## Sample file structure
A standard file structure will help us ensure that logs from different services remain consistent, making it easier for people to find the logs if they switch projects.

The agreed structure is:
`Service > Phase > Functionality/block of research > Date the entry relates to > UR/design entry`

So that becomes, for example:
`NHS Jobs > Public beta > Kick-out screens > June to August 2021 > Content Design`

## Headings to Structure your UCD log

Include a relevant title in the introduction to the UCD log, summarising the work discussed.

Include your name, email address and the date, to keep an audit of the completed work. This will allow readers to reach out to you with any questions they may have.

### Why we did this work

If you’re working in sprints, include the sprint goal and some context around how your work fits into the sprint. If the work takes place over multiple sprints, include the sprint numbers as reference. If working using Kanban, the file structure should be ordered in the way Kanban is being ran.

Timelines are an effective way to present the journey from initial research to design. They give readers a better understanding of how the work came about and the user need for it. They also show any changes which impacted on the design and its iterations.

Make sure you present any timelines in an accessible format. Any infographic would need to have an accessible alternative, for example.

Giving insight into your design decisions is key. Information about your design thinking, and how this influences your decision making, will show what you’ve considered and why you made particular decisions. If you need to revisit work, looking through previous decisions could show what areas you need to look at.

### What our ideas were

It’s always useful to document information architecture and provide visuals of any changes or redesigns of the content or structure. This will keep designs consistent.

Wireframes are a useful way to document the ideation process and to show your different ideas and thought processes. Include any insight into any content decisions you’ve made and how they will impact the user in their journey. Include changes to single words or phrases, as well as larger content redesigns that will improve user experience.

We use hypothesis-driven design, based on research, to explain what we plan to test to solve any underlying problems. You should include these as part of your log.

Follow this format:

We believe that [creating this experience] will be a useful feature for [user] as it will [outcome].

For example: 

We believe that allowing applicants to search for their address using their postcode will be a useful feature for all invited applicants, as it will allow them to complete their application quicker.

### How we tested them and what we found

You must provide specific screen URLs as part of your UCD log. Make sure you include any details needed to access these – generic username and password, for example.

If you need to enter specific data into certain fields to continue through the user journey, provide this information. If the prototype is set up to follow a persona, make sure you include the persona details.

Share the key findings from user testing in your UCD log to show how evidence from user research has influenced your designs and iterations. You’ll only need to summarise these findings, as user researchers will include more in-depth information in their User Research log.

By keeping a log of the content changes, you’re creating an audit trail and a history of the design’s iterative progress. This benefits the service and anyone who wants to see how the content has progressed over time.

### What we will do next

Give some information on what the next steps will be. Consider adding information such as:

- if the content is likely to iterated again soon
- if we are waiting on more information from the service or from user research 

Detail things you were not able to do at this stage that you want to raise later and show how this further requirement has been documented.

### Resources

Provide any other relevant links to resources relevant to the work this UCD log relates to. Explain why these resources are relevant.

You may want to include links to:

- Jira tickets
- Miro boards
- SharePoint files or folders
- Recorded videos 
- User research feedback
