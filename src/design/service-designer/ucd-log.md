The below guidance has been written to help service designers in completing and supporting their service team’s User Centred Design log. This is a general guide to best practice and any specific service questions must be raised with the service team.

The log will be used to inform the reader about the service design activity undertaken and the outcomes of that work. It is important that you as a designer ensure that there are no knowledge gaps within your log so that it can be used to support any new team member onboarding the service team, particularly those who will be joining the UCD team. It will also provide valuable information in supporting a project service assessment. 

The following information outlines the steps you should take to create your design log entry:

## Sample file structure

A standard file structure will help us ensure that logs from different services remain consistent, making it easier for people to find the logs if they switch projects.

The agreed structure is:
`Service > Phase > Functionality/block of research > Date entry covers > UR/design entry`

So that becomes, for example:
`NHS Jobs > Public beta > Search function > June – August 2021 > Service Design`

## Structure around a single piece of work

Each entry should be structured around a particular piece of work. This will be different depending on what your project is working on and the phase it is in. For example, the entry may be written about 6-8 weeks' piece of work about a new functionality for your service. Alternatively, it may be written about a work that happened over the course of a single sprint.

Date the entry so that it is clear how long it was worked upon. If you come back to working on the same thing again in the future, create a new entry that is clearly dated and explains why further work is being conducted.

## Background information

Each entry should include an overview of the service goals and/or policy intent, and how this specific piece of work will help the team achieve these goals. It may be useful to relate to a specific piece of research. In this case, be sure to include a link to the relevant UR log. You should also outline the phase that your project is in, e.g. Discovery, Alpha, etc.

## Description of design decisions

Provide a clear narrative of the design decision taken so that it can be easily understood by someone new to the project. This may include details such as: the process taken to reach the decision; any data used to support this decision; and how it relates to other pieces of work or decisions previously taken. Make sure to provide links to any other entries that are mentioned in your description. 

## Relevant links and screenshots

Aim to include visuals, where available, to aid understanding. If there are any artefacts or outputs relevant to the design decision, you should provide a screenshot of the relevant section(s). It may be useful to include a before and after screenshot to help highlight changes made. Visuals could include screenshots of: blueprints, including frontstage and backstage actions; eco-system maps; user journey maps/user flows, etc. You don’t need to include screenshots of prototypes and/or content changes in screens as these should be logged by the interaction and content designers.

As well as screenshots, you should include any links that are relevant to your entry. This includes but is not limited to: Miro boards; Teams folders; and Confluence spaces. You do not need to provide links to prototypes or GitHub repositories, as the interaction designer on your project will be collating this information.

## Outstanding work

Explain loose ends and how it will drive future work. You can describe if there’s anything that you wanted to achieve but was out of scope, and if there are any recommendations on future work. These could be:

- What you didn’t manage to explore
- What has come out of this work that you need to look at in the next sprint?
- Backlog of work

## Service assessments

Make it clear what phase of the assessment process your entry relates to. For example, if your service is in Private Beta and the piece of work or artefact supports that, then be sure to reference it.

Design is assessed exclusively under GDS (Government Digital Service) standards 2 and 3, and we also contribute to standards 4 and 5 [https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard)

Alongside the GDS service standards we have 3 extra NHS standards, they will not be assessed but you will need to be aware of them and work towards them. Those are service standards 14, 15 and 17 [https://service-manual.nhs.uk/standards-and-technology/service-standard](https://service-manual.nhs.uk/standards-and-technology/service-standard)
