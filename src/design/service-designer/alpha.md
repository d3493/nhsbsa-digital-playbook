## What is expected from a Service Designer in Alpha

In the Alpha phase, the team aims to develop and refine early versions of the product or service. As a Service Designer, your key responsibilities might involve:


- collaborating with cross-functional team members (user researchers, business analysts, technical architects, delivery managers, product owners, etc.) to refine service concepts based on user feedback.
- defining the service blueprint and refining technologies and process with cross-departmental teams for delivery
- creating processes and influencing operations that will ensure the futureproofing and efficient delivery/ return of a service once implemented and running with appropriate due diligence to risk and constraint 
- creating a consistent user experience with other NHS / GOV services
- considering all routes that users take into and out of the service
- considering the context of each user group i.e. how the service will look and work for all demographics
- making clear rationale with all stakeholders and users, both internal and external for the full service ecosystem and not just one element of the service
- documenting the changes to the service over time using a UCD Log i.e. what was created and why, what you planned to test (hypothesis) and what did you find
