## What is expected from an Interaction Designer in Discovery

During the Discovery phase, the focus is on understanding the project goals, user needs, and identifying potential design opportunities.

Typically this phase requires a Service Designer rather than an Interaction Designer, however if required, as an Interaction Designer, your expected contributions may include:

- developing your understanding of users needs and pain points
- auditing existing systems, and understand how much they can be used as-is or whether they have significant accessibility, usability, or NHS.UK / GOV.UK pattern adherence problems.
- working with the rest of the team to understand how the policy, technology choices and user needs will affect interaction design decisions
- if required, prototyping concepts to test ideas and challenge decisions that have already been made, while championing accessible and NHS.UK / GOV.UK design system adherent choices
