## Roles and Accountabilities

### User Researcher

* Accountable for conducting user research activities to gather insights into user behaviours, needs, and preferences. 
* Responsible for analysing research findings and communicating actionable insights to inform design decisions. 
* Focuses on empathy with users, uncovering user needs, and validating design hypotheses. 

### Service Designer

* Accountable for understanding the overall service ecosystem, including user needs, pain points, and touchpoints. 
* Responsible for defining the end-to-end user journey and identifying opportunities for improvement. 
* Focuses on strategic planning, stakeholder alignment, and business impact. 

### Interaction Designer

* Accountable for designing intuitive and engaging user interfaces across digital and physical touchpoints. 
* Responsible for translating user insights and requirements into interactive prototypes and design specifications. 
* Focuses on usability, accessibility, and interaction design principles. 

### Content Designer

* Accountable for creating and managing content across various touchpoints, ensuring consistency, clarity, and alignment with user needs. 
* Responsible for crafting messaging, copy, and visual content that resonates with users and supports their tasks and goals. 
* Focuses on language, tone, and storytelling to enhance the overall user experience. 

## Collaboration Expectations

* User Researcher, Service Designer, Interaction Designer and Content Designer will collaborate closely throughout the design process to ensure a seamless and cohesive user experience. 
* Regular communication and information sharing are essential to maintain alignment and address any emerging issues or challenges.
* All four roles will actively participate in design reviews, user testing sessions, and stakeholder workshops to gather feedback and iterate on designs. 

### What a User Researcher needs from a Service Designer, Interaction Designer and Content Designer

* While the User Researcher will lead the planning and execution of all research sessions, there should always be support from at least one of Service Designer, Interaction Designer, and Content Designer in documenting observations from these sessions, including tasks like note-taking. 
* Support from the Service Designer and Interaction Designer in translating user research findings into actionable design recommendations and improvements. 
* Collaboration on prioritizing research objectives and aligning research activities with the overall service strategy and objectives. 
* Access to design artifacts and prototypes from the Interaction Designer to facilitate user feedback and validation during research activities. 

### What a Service Designer needs from a User Researcher, Interaction Designer and Content Designer

* Clear and concise communication of design decisions, rationale, and implications for the overall service experience. 
* High-Fidelity prototypes and design specifications from the Interaction Designer that accurately represent the intended user interactions and functionalities. 
* User research findings and insights from the User Researcher that inform service design decisions and help prioritize design enhancements. 

### What an Interaction Designer needs from a User Researcher, Service Designer and Content Designer

* Comprehensive understanding of user research findings, personas etcâ€¦ from the User Researcher to inform interaction design decisions. 
* Alignment on the overall service vision, goals, and priorities from the Service Designer to ensure consistency and coherence across touchpoints. 
* Collaboration on defining user flows, wireframes, and interaction patterns that support the desired service outcomes. 

### What a Content Designer needs from a User Researcher, Service Designer and Interaction Designer

* Collaboration on understanding user needs, preferences, and behaviours to tailor content and messaging accordingly. 
* Access to design artifacts and prototypes from the Interaction Designer and Service Designer to ensure content integration and alignment with the overall user experience. 
* Involvement in user research activities conducted by the User Researcher to gather insights and validate content decisions. 

## Key Activities and Deliverables

### User Researcher

* Research plans outlining objectives, methodologies, and participant recruitment criteria. 
* Research findings reports including insights, observations, and recommendations. 
* User personas, journey maps, and other artifacts synthesizing research findings for design teams. 

### Service Designer

* Service blueprints outlining the end-to-end user journey and touchpoints. 
* Stakeholder presentations and workshops to communicate service vision and strategy. 

### Interaction Designer

* Prototypes, user flows and design mock-ups for digital and physical interfaces. 
* Design specifications and style guides to ensure consistency and scalability. 
* Usability testing reports and recommendations for improving interaction design. 

### Content Designer

* Content strategy documents outlining messaging, tone, and content requirements. 
* Content creation and management across various touchpoints, including websites, apps, and marketing materials. 
* Content audits and optimizations to ensure alignment with user needs and service objectives. 

## Decision-Making Process

* Decisions related to overall service strategy, user needs, and business objectives will involve all four roles, with input from relevant stakeholders e.g. Product Owners 
* Design decisions specific to interaction design, usability, content, and aesthetics will be collaboratively made based on user insights provided by the User Researcher and alignment with the service vision defined by the Service Designer. 
* All four roles will collaborate to evaluate options, weigh trade-offs, and prioritize design enhancements based on user feedback and project constraints. 

## Continuous Improvement

* User Researcher, Service Designer, Interaction Designer and Content Designer will regularly review and reflect on their collaboration process to identify areas for improvement and implement best practices. 
* Feedback from users, stakeholders, and team members will be used to iterate on designs and refine the overall service experience over time. 
* By adhering to these guidelines, the Service Designer, Interaction Designer, User Researcher and Content Designer can foster a collaborative and productive working relationship, resulting in user-centered and impactful service experiences.
